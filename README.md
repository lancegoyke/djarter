# `djarter` â€“ An opinionated Django starter project

I have spent six years resisting the urge to make a starter template because (a) it locks you in to a particular development style, and (b) it prevents repetition which promotes learning.

But in the spirit of getting things done, this repo contains a few best practices and useful tools for Django projects.

These features would take a while to get set up from scratch, and might not be worth it for every project. But cloning this starter template can save you roughly a full day of work.

Most importantly, though, no Bootstrap styling was used in the making of this template.

## How to use `djarter`

### Make a copy of the template

Click the green "Use this template" button on the repository page. This creates a shallow copy, making a new repository with a single commit under your account.

### Setup the database

The template is ready to use SQLite for your database out of the box.

```shell
python manage.py migrate
```

### Create a superuser

```shell
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### Run the tests

```shell
python manage.py test
```

### Run the development server

```shell
python manage.py runserver
```

### Customizations

Then, here are some areas you'll likely want to customize:

- [ ] `pyproject.toml` contains project info
- [ ] `static/style.css` has customizable CSS variables at the top of the file
- [ ] Edit your site name in the Django sites framework from within the admin at http://127.0.0.1:8000/backside; this value is used when sending password reset emails
- [ ] `cp .env-example .env` and adjust values
- [ ] Update the meta description and keywords in `templates/base.html`
